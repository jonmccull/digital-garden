<h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em">Synopsis</h2>

<i>From [April Dunford](https://www.aprildunford.com/obviously-awesome)</i>:

Forget everything you thought you knew about [[Positioning]]. Successfully connecting your product with consumers isn’t a matter of filling in the blanks on an old-school positioning statement. Positioning is the foundation of everything we do in marketing and sales. It forms the backbone of our go-to-market strategy. Yet we don’t have a defined methodology for DOING it. At least we didn’t until now.

<i>Obviously Awesome</i> goes beyond teaching you what positioning is and why you should care. It gives you a step by step process that any startup can follow to position their product, service or company. This book will teach you how to find your product’s “secret sauce” and then sell that sauce to those who crave it.


<h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em">Notes</h2>
- [[Positioning]] is what sets the context for a product. It helps people make sense of a product they're encountering for the first time.<input type="checkbox" id="cb7" /><label for="cb7"><sup></sup></label><span><span class="footnote-inner">I like to describe [[Positioning]] as “context setting” for products. When we encounter something new, we will attempt to make sense of it by gathering together all of the little clues we can quickly find to determine how we should think about this new thing. Without that context, products are very difficult to understand, and the whole company suffers—not just the marketing and sales teams.

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em">Highlights</h2>

- Every single marketing and sales tactic that we use in business today uses positioning as an input and a foundation. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=145))
- [[Positioning]] is the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot about. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=147))
- [[Positioning]] is a fundamental input into every tactic we execute, every campaign we launch, every piece of content we create, every sales pitch we make. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=150))

- I like to describe [[Positioning]] as “context setting” for products. When we encounter something new, we will attempt to make sense of it by gathering together all of the little clues we can quickly find to determine how we should think about this new thing. Without that context, products are very difficult to understand, and the whole company suffers—not just the marketing and sales teams.

- The concept of [[Positioning]] first became a popular marketing construct in 1981 with the publication of [[Positioning – The Battle for Your Mind]] by Al Ries and Jack Trout. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=175))
- Ries and Trout argued that markets had become crowded with copycat products, and buyers were overwhelmed with the volume of marketing aimed at them. In order to break through the noise, companies would need to take into account their own strengths and weaknesses, then contrast them with their competitors to create a unique leadership position in the minds of customers. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=177))
- Customers need to be able to easily understand what your product is, why it’s special and why it matters to them. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=215))
- [[Positioning]] products is a lot like context setting in the opening of a movie. The opening scene helps the viewer quickly answer a list of basic questions that give context for the story about to unfold. Where are the characters? Who are they, and should the viewer love them or hate them? Is the story going to be sad or scary or funny? 
    - Think of the opening scene in Apocalypse Now. You see a dense grove of peaceful palm trees swaying in the breeze. But then you start to notice some smoke coming from the bottom of the screen and a helicopter moves quickly across. The palm trees burst into flames as Jim Morrison says, “This is the end.” The setting is no longer a beach in the Caribbean; it’s a war in the jungle. The scene slowly shifts from the burning jungle to Martin Sheen’s face and you realize you’re seeing his traumatic memories. He’s smoking, he’s drinking, he’s got a gun, and your mother would have something to say about the state of that hotel room. He walks over to the window and looks out, and you hear his thoughts. “Saigon. Shit. I’m still only in Saigon. Every time I think I’m gonna wake up back in the jungle.” The movie is four minutes and forty-five seconds in, but you have enough context to know what it’s all about. It’s set in the middle of the Vietnam War, the main character has some serious PTSD, and if you thought this was going to be a two-hour laugh riot, you are dead wrong. Hey, they did warn you with the title. The opening scene positions the movie so you can stop wondering about the big questions of where, what, why and who and move onto focusing on the story itself within that context. 
    - When customers encounter a product they have never seen before, they will look for contextual clues to help them figure out what it is, who it’s for and why they should care. Taken together, the messaging, pricing, features, branding, partners and customers create context and set the scene for the product.

- Context can completely transform the way we think about a product. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=262))
    - **Note**: Violinist example - world class violinist in the context of a streetperforming changed the audience's perception of his qualtiy.
- For people who build and sell things, the frame of reference that a potential customer chooses can make or break the business. Coke is much more than just fizzy water in the same way that a concert violinist is more than just a street performer with a fiddle. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=292))
- While we understand that context is important, we generally fail to deliberately choose a context because we believe that the context for our product is obvious. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=302))
    - **Note**: Being "too close to the product" can often lead to makers not seeing their product's context through the eyes of potential customers. Be wary of thinking your product's context is obvious.
- Without meaning to, we trap ourselves within our own context. We don’t know how to shift the framework to best communicate what our product actually is or what it does. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=309))
    - **Note**: Deciding on the context of a product (e.g.. it's category) you are making a set of critical business decisions that would likely be more effective to take individually. For example: Target buyers and where you sell; competitive alternatives; pricing and margin; and key product features and roadmap.
	- In the case of [[Vivaldi]], the assumption is that we should categorise it as a "browser". There is certainly a context imbued to potential users simply by calling Vivaldi a "browser". Is this the context we want to set?
- As product creators, we need to understand that the choices we make in [[Positioning]] and context can have a massive impact on our businesses—for better or worse. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=336))
- Sometimes a product that was well positioned in a market suddenly becomes poorly positioned, not because the product itself has changed, but because markets around the product have shifted. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=351))
    - **Note**: The "diet muffin" example. Initially, it's a success. But the market can change and "diets" are no longer in vogue – competitors positioned as "health muffins" or "after gym snack" will overtake you.
- The common failure in both of these traps is not deliberately [[Positioning]] the product. We stick with a “default” positioning, even when the product changes or the market changes. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=368))
- We generally fail to consider other—potentially better—ways to position our products because we simply aren’t [[Positioning]] them deliberately. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=395))
- > “Find out who you are and do it on purpose.” – Dolly Parton
- Great [[Positioning]] takes into account all of the following: 
    - The customer’s point of view on the problem you solve and the alternative ways of solving that problem. 
    - The ways you are uniquely different from those alternatives and why that’s meaningful for customers. 
    - The characteristics of a potential customer that really values what you can uniquely deliver. 
    - The best market context for your product that makes your unique value obvious to those customers who are best suited to your product. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PPW5V9C&location=436))
