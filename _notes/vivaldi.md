Vivaldi is building a browser that's powerful, personal and flexible. A browser that adapts to you, not the other way around.

## What do I do at Vivaldi?
I joined a small marketing team as Growth Marketing Manager in 2016. At the start of 2021 I took on the Head of [[Product Marketing]] role to tackle [branding](/branding-a-browser){: .internal-link}, user acquisition and activation. I work at the intersection of product development, marketing, PR, and tech, with a view of gaining growth in the millions of users globally.

## What makes Vivaldi different?

### More features, not less
I don't know about you, but I spend a lot of time in my browser. Shouldn't it do everything you need it to out-of-the-box? Vivaldi thinks so. 

Rather than passing the buck (e.g. to third-party extensions<input type="checkbox" id="cb7" /><label for="cb7"><sup></sup></label><span><span class="footnote-inner">...which can hurt performance, open you up to security issues, or leave you high and dry when the extension goes unsupported (as was the case recently with [The Great Suspender](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266798/chrome-blocks-the-great-suspender-disabled-malware-tab-recovery)).</span></span>) Vivaldi comes with an insane amount of built-in functionality. There are the flagship, unique-to-Vivaldi features like Notes, Web Panels, Break Mode, Image Properties and [(a lot) more](https://vivaldi.com/features/). But there are is also a pile of functionality available to tweak; as well as multiple ways to control and interact with the browser (e.g. Mouse Gestures, fully customisable Keyboard Shortcuts, or Quick Commands).

A personal fave of mine at the moment is Two-Level Tab Stacks<input type="checkbox" id="cb1" /><label for="cb1"><sup></sup></label><span><span class="footnote-inner">Grouping tabs together into a [Tab Stack](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/tabs/tab-stacks/) allows you to quickly perform commands on multiple tabs at once, keep the tab bar less cluttered and be more organised about your browser window layout. In January, 2021, Vivaldi released [Two-Level Tab Stacks](https://vivaldi.com/blog/desktop/desktop-releases/vivaldi-tabs-two-level/), which adds a second row to the tab bar to show the contents of a Tab Stack.<br><br> "Grouped tabs can become pseudo-workspaces for whatever you get up to in your browser." â€“ [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253198/vivaldi-web-browser-stacked-tabs-hoarding)<br><br>![](/assets/2_line_tab_stack_side_by_side.webp)</span></span> combined with Tab Tiling. Here's how that looks in action:

### Everything's an option
Vivaldi's aim is to work for anyone so it give you options. Lots and lots of options. You choose how Vivaldi works, what features to use and how it looks.

### There are no rules
How your browser works is up to you. There are multiple ways to access and control most things in Vivaldi. Play around and find what works for you.

### Geeking-out is the way
Tweaking software to get it working just right for you is a totally underrated pastime. Vivaldi is made for exploring, fine-tuning and discovering what a browser can do.
