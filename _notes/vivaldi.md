Vivaldi is building a browser that's powerful, personal and flexible. A browser that adapts to you, not the other way around.

## What do I do at Vivaldi?
I joined a small marketing team as Growth Marketing Manager in 2016. At the start of 2021 I took on the Head of [[Product Marketing]] role to tackle [branding](/branding-a-browser){: .internal-link}, user acquisition and activation. I work at the intersection of product development, marketing, PR, and tech, with a view of gaining growth in the millions of users globally.

## What makes Vivaldi different?

### More features, not less
You spend a lot of time in your browser. It should do everything you need out-of-the-box. Vivaldi comes with built-in features like Notes, Screen Capture, Image Properties and (a lot) more.

A personal fave of mine at the moment is Two-Level Tab Stacks<input type="checkbox" id="cb1" /><label for="cb1"><sup></sup></label><span><span class="footnote-inner">Grouping tabs together into a [Tab Stack](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/tabs/tab-stacks/) allows you to quickly perform commands on multiple tabs at once, keep the tab bar less cluttered and be more organised about your browser window layout. In January, 2021, Vivaldi released [Two-Level Tab Stacks](https://vivaldi.com/blog/desktop/desktop-releases/vivaldi-tabs-two-level/), which adds a second row to the tab bar to show the contents of a Tab Stack.<br><br> "Grouped tabs can become pseudo-workspaces for whatever you get up to in your browser." â€“ [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253198/vivaldi-web-browser-stacked-tabs-hoarding)<br><br>![](/assets/2_line_tab_stack_side_by_side.webp)</span></span> combined with Tab Tiling<input type="checkbox" id="cb2" /><label for="cb2"><sup></sup></label><span><span class="footnote-inner">Vivaldi allows you to view multiple tabs in split-screen using a feature called [Tab Tiling](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/tabs/tab-tiling/). "Tiling" tabs means creating a split-screen view of the whichever tabs you've selected; as in, splitting your window into distinct tiles.</span></span>.

### Everything's an option
Vivaldi's aim is to work for anyone so it give you options. Lots and lots of options. You choose how Vivaldi works, what features to use and how it looks. This is your browser, after all.

### There are no rules
How your browser works is up to you. There are multiple ways to access and control most things in Vivaldi. Play around and find what works for you.

### Geeking-out is the way
Tweaking software to get it working just right for you is a totally underrated pastime. Vivaldi is made for exploring, fine-tuning and discovering what a browser can do.
