## Description

"Idea Work is the culmination of a four-year research project that examines extraordinary creative and collaborative work in practice. The authors take you behind the scenes of some of Norway’s leading companies, showing how surprisingly similarly they work to develop and realize new ideas. Case studies of prominent companies like StatOil, as well as Snøhetta’s process for designing the Opera House in Oslo, and the National 9/11 Memorial Museum Pavilion in New York." – [Snøhetta](https://snohetta.com/project/55-idea-work)
