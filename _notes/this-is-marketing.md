## Description

If there's one author synonymous with marketing, it's [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/TIM/). Too many marketing books, articles and resources bury their learnings in fluff. Godin's style has always been to go deep â€“ not by adding superfluous context or detail, but by eliminating any potential distraction to his message. And that's what I appreciate most about his latest book, <em>This is Marketing</em>. It's too the point, concise and bulletproof. 

Here's how Seth himself describes it:

> "It builds a bridge between the old way of marketing, something we do <em>at</em> people and <em>to</em> people, to a modern way of thinking about marketing â€“ as something we do <em>for</em> people. 

> That the purpose of marketing isn't to sell your stuff. The purpose of marketing is to help your people get to where they want to go."

> â€“ [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/TIM/) on <em>This is Marketing</em>
