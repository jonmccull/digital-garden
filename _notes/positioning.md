## What is Positioning?

When a potential customer encounters a product, good positioning should enable them to easily understand what the product does, how it's different from the rest and why it matters to them.

Where [[Branding]] focuses on a user's reaction and emotional experience choosing and using a product, positioning sets the context for that product in the market. It helps people make sense of something they're encountering for the first time.
