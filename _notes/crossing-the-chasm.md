## Description

<i>From [HarperCollins Publishers](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/crossing-the-chasm-3rd-edition-geoffrey-a-moore?variant=32130444066850):</i>

The bible for bringing cutting-edge products to larger marketsâ€”now revised and updated with new insights into the realities of high-tech marketing.

In _Crossing the Chasm_, Geoffrey A. Moore shows that in the Technology Adoption Life Cycleâ€”which begins with innovators and moves to [[early adopters]], early majority, late majority, and laggardsâ€”there is a vast chasm between the early adopters and the early majority. While early adopters are willing to sacrifice for the advantage of being first<input type="checkbox" id="cb7" /><label for="cb7"><sup></sup></label><span><span class="footnote-inner">"Neophiliacs are not adapters: They crave the new." â€“ Seth Godin in [[This is Marketing]]</span></span>, the early majority waits until they know that the technology actually offers improvements in productivity. The challenge for innovators and marketers is to narrow this chasm and ultimately accelerate adoption across every segment.

This [third edition](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/crossing-the-chasm-3rd-edition-geoffrey-a-moore?variant=32130444066850) brings Moore's classic work up to date with dozens of new examples of successes and failures, new strategies for marketing in the digital world, and Moore's most current insights and findings. He also includes two new appendices, the first connecting the ideas in _Crossing the Chasm_ to work subsequently published in his _Inside the Tornado_, and the second presenting his recent groundbreaking work for technology adoption models for high-tech consumer markets.
