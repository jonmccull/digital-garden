## What is Product Marketing?

Product marketing is the driving force behind getting a product to market (and keeping it there). Product marketers use customer, market and competitive research to develop [[Positioning]], messaging and audience segmentation strategies that take into account the broader context of a product offering.

A product marketer's job is to clearly articulate the product's value in a way that resonates with the target market to drive adoption and advocacy.<input type="checkbox" id="cb7" /><label for="cb7"><sup></sup></label><span><span class="footnote-inner">"[Product marketers are] the people responsible for being able to understand ‚Äì and therefore articulate ‚Äì what is different and better and remarkable about your for offering, for your target people." ‚Äì [April Dunford](https://twitter.com/aprildunford?lang=en) in [Product Marketing Alliance](https://productmarketingalliance.com/what-is-product-marketing/).</span></span> Internally, product marketing should represent the voice of customer before, during and after launch.

The scope of the Product Marketing function will typically include four areas:

### Research

Conducting both quantitative and qualitative research with of a view of understanding customers at every stage of the user journey (potential, existing, churn risk and customers who've dropped it for an alternative).

Contribute to the ongoing competitive analysis effort by tracking overarching market trends and patterns.


### Positioning

The Product Marketing function leads on [[Positioning]] strategy, which includes two distinct areas: Product Positioning and Brand Positioning. 

Using insights from research, market trends and their knowledge of the category's competition, Product Marketing drives the definition of [[Product Positioning]] using factors including the ideal customer, use-cases, features, capabilities, benefits, and competitors. Typically, Product Positioning remains stable for periods of 12-18 months.

Product Marketing works in collaboration with other marketing initiatives to evolve the Product Positioning in the market and category, as well as be an advocate for users in Go-to-Market and launch planning.

<strong>Brand Positioning</strong> is perhaps the more "foundational" element of positioning in the business strategy (remaining stable for 5-10 years). It refers to the mission, vision, personality of the company.


### Go-to-Market

Go-to-Market encompasses the sum total of activities (i.e. ‚Äúthe engine‚Äù) that gets your product to your ideal customers. üöÄ

### Messaging

[[Messaging]] work in relation to Product Marketing could also fall under the umbrella of "Lifecycle Marketing", if there's a distinct function for that within the organisation.<input type="checkbox" id="cb8" /><label for="cb8"><sup></sup></label><span><span class="footnote-inner">"As a Product Marketing organization grows, this attribute may be one of the first to split off into its own specialty role: Lifecycle Marketing. Either way, it‚Äôs important for the product marketer to have awareness about lifecycle messaging and to think strategically about how to implement smart messaging strategies ‚Äî messaging is one of the top ways to achieve PMM goals." ‚Äì [Kevan Lee](https://twitter.com/kevanlee), in [Product Marketing Playbook](https://kevanlee.substack.com/p/204-product-marketing-playbook)</span></span> 

Messaging is the envelope that carries [[Product Positioning]]. The goal is to craft the story and narrative you want to tell and deliver this in effective ways at the appropriate time throughout the user journey.

This means, in the case of a SaaS product for example, creating Messaging that is used in-app, but also to drive product preference and adoption (e.g. websites, external communications, case studies and white papers.)

Other areas of responsibility typical to Product Marketing teams:

### Sales Enablement

Materials and "fuel" for Sales activities including battle cards, decks, and key narratives on how to best position the product to customers in relation to competition.
