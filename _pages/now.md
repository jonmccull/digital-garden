# What I'm doing now

<em>This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.</em>

## Next moves

At the end of March I was [let go](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonmccullough_productmarketing-layoffs2023-activity-7052166020798525440-QCq1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) from my job at Slite (along with 25% of the company). After a few quiet weeks I'm starting to dig into the job hunt properly now, looking for new remote opportunities in Product Marketing.

## What I'm reading

I've got a few books on the go right now:

- The Creative Act
- <a class="internal-link" href="/book/whats-our-problem/">What's Our Problem: A Self-Help Book for Societies</a> 
- The Saints of Salvation

## Intermitent Fasting

## Tech Independence



## Vestandlet
