# What I'm doing now

> <em>This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.</em>

Early in the year I was [let go](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonmccullough_productmarketing-layoffs2023-activity-7052166020798525440-QCq1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) from my job at [Slite](https://slite.com/), along with 25% of the company. From April to September I took a much needed break to spend time with my son Ola (born in January) and make the move to the west coast of Norway.

At the end of September I joined [Deel](https://deel.com/) as a Team Lead on the [[Product Marketing]] team. Ramping up in the new job and settling into our new home take up most of my time these days!
