  <p class="hero-title" style="padding-top: 20px;">This site is a digital garden. Things that end up here have bubbled-up from notes and resources used in my work. It changes as I learn something new or my thinking evolves.</p>
  
  <p class="hero-title" style="padding-top: 20px;">Everything's a work in progress. 🌱</p>
  
  <p>Here are a few nice places to dive in:</p>
