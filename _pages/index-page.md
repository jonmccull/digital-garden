  <p style="padding-bottom:20px;">Jon McCullough</p>
  <p class="hero-title" style="padding-top: 20px;">I'm a <a class="internal-link" href="/product-marketing/">product marketer</a> based in Oslo interested specifically in the <a class="internal-link" href="/positioning">positioning</a> and growth tactics of ethical software. In May I'll be joining <a href="https://slite.com">Slite</a> as Senior Product Marketing Manager.</p>
  
  <p>This site is my version of a digital garden. I don't do typical blog posts or even order things by date. Things that end up here have bubbled-up from notes and resources related to my work. They change as I learn something new or my thinking evolves. Everything's a work in progress. ðŸŒ±</p>
  <p>A good place to start would be any of the links in the intro up top. :)</p>
