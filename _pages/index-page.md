  <p class="hero-title" style="padding-top: 20px;">I'm a <a class="internal-link" href="/product-marketing/">product marketer</a> based in Oslo interested specifically in the positioning and growth tactics of ethical software. Currently I'm working at <a class="internal-link" href="/vivaldi/">Vivaldi</a>.</p>
  
  <p>This site is my version of a digital garden. I don't do typical blog posts or even order things by date. Things that end up here have bubbled-up from notes and resources related to my work<input type="checkbox" id="cb7" /><label for="cb7"><sup></sup></label><span><span class="footnote-inner">I should probably expand on this, but let's just say I'm a big [[Roam]] fan. The "networked thought" approach to note-taking has been a game-changer for me. The workflow of referencing, bi-directional linking and ever-evolving notes in Roam was a big inspiration for this site.</span></span>. They change as I learn something new or my thinking evolves. Everything's a work in progress.</p>
  <p>A good place to start would be either of the links in the intro up top, or my notes on the book I'm currently reading, <em><a class="internal-link" href="/book/this-is-marketing/">This is Marketing</a></em> :)</p>
